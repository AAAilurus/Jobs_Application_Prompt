I want you to write a complete technical document in the same style, structure, and tone as my previous reports.

Topic: [INSERT TOPIC HERE]

Requirements:

1. Writing Style:
- Use clean academic English.
- Prefer paragraph explanations over bullet points.
- Explain concepts in simple but technically correct language.
- Every section must explain:
  - What the concept is
  - Why it is needed
  - What each matrix / equation means physically
- Avoid short notes. Write full explanatory paragraphs.
- Make it readable from top to bottom like a guide.

2. Structure:
Follow this exact structure:

1. Purpose and Big Picture  
2. System and Learning Workflow  
3. System Model (State, Input, and Dynamics)  
4. Forward Problem (if applicable)  
5. Core Mathematical Representation  
6. Key Equations and Their Meaning  
7. Inverse / Learning Problem Formulation  
8. Optimization Method  
9. Exact or Approximate Gradient (if relevant)  
10. Projection / Stability / Constraints  
11. Complete Algorithm (explained in paragraphs, not pseudocode)  
12. Meaning of Important Matrices (Quick Guide section)  
13. Multi-Agent or Dual-System Extension (if applicable)  
14. Common Issues  
15. Conclusion  

3. Mathematical Style:
- Use proper LaTeX equations.
- Define every symbol clearly.
- Explain every matrix dimension.
- When introducing equations, explain what they mean physically.
- Avoid skipping derivation steps if they are conceptually important.

4. Tone:
- Same tone as a clean PhD-level control systems report.
- Clear, logical, structured.
- No emojis.
- No casual language.
- No bullet-heavy formatting.
- Mostly paragraph-based explanation.

5. Output Format:
- Provide clean LaTeX code.
- Use \section{} for sections.
- No extra commentary outside LaTeX.
- Make it ready to paste into Overleaf.

Make it complete and self-contained.
Assume the reader knows control theory basics but needs conceptual clarity.
